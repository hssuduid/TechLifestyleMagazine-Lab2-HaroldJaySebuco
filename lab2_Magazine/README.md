Design Choices:

Used a clean white and gray layout with blue accents for links and highlights.

Applied ‘Playfair Display’ for headings and ‘Roboto’ for body text to balance elegance and readability.

Designed a dark overlay hero section with a background image for contrast and emphasis.

Created hover zoom effects on article images with subtle shadows for depth.

Arranged homepage article cards in a responsive grid layout.

Styled the articles page with an inline layout: fixed-size thumbnails on the left and text content on the right, ensuring order and readability.

Added responsive design rules for tablets and mobile (flex-column stacking, smaller typography, and adjusted padding).
